    "Spotify uses a metric called *valence* to measure the happiness of a track. The metric itself, however, was not developed by Spotify. It was originally developed by Echo Nest, a company that was bought by Spotify in 2014. We don't know exactly how valence is calculated. Some details are given by a blog post, which you can find here:\n",

You may seek help on the Internet, by Googling or searching in StackOverflow for general questions pertaining to the use of Python,  libraries, and idioms. However, it is not right to ask direct questions that relate to the assignment and where people will actually solve your problem by answering them. You may discuss with your fellow students in order to better understand the questions, if they are not clear enough, but you should not ask them to share their answers with you, or to help you by giving specific advice."
